# The function for calculating the version from the git repository.
# The version is calculated as follows:

# X.Y.Z[+D][.revHASH], where

# X.Y - the digits are taken from the last tag, this is the main version
# Z - is the number of the commits in master branch after the last tag + the third digit in the tag itself. So, if the last tag is 3.3.4, and there are 2 commits in the master branch, the result is 3.3.6. So, the Z is reserved for the patches.
# D - is the number of commits in development branch after its deviation from the master.
# HASH - is the short commit hash in the feature branch (not development and not master). In this case, the D value is incremented (+1) as well. This is done because of the versioning order convention in PyPi.

# So, the master branch has the versions in the form X.Y.Z, development - X.Y.Z+D, the other branches X.Y.Z+D.revHASH

# For example, the sorted versions list might look like
# 3.3.0
# 3.3.1
# 3.3.1+1
# 3.3.1+2
# 3.3.1+3.rev1a2b3d ‚Üê this is why +1 is added, because such versions are considered to be younger
# 3.3.1+3
# 3.3.2
